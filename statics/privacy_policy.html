    <h2>Privacy policies</h2>

    <p>Somalia wants the user to feel confident in using the platform and is committed to protecting the information it
        collects. While no site can guarantee absolute security, we have implemented appropriate administrative,
        technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For
        example, only authorized employees are allowed to access personal information and may only do so to perform
        permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting the user's personal information
        between the respective system and the system used by Somalia, and that of the partners with whom we share
        confidential information. Additionally, we use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent
        unauthorized persons from gaining access to user information. Somalia collects, processes, and transmits the
        personal data of users in accordance with the applicable provisions of the data protection law in force in
        Washington D.C. USA.</p>
    <p>Somalia receives and stores any information that the user enters on the platform or provides in any other way.
        This includes information that can identify the user (personal information), such as the first and last name,
        telephone number, and e-mail, username. We also store data about user surveys and comments. The user has the
        option of not providing information, but, in general, some information about the user is necessary for them to
        receive relevant offers from Somalia and its partners and to enjoy other advantages of being a registered user.
        For example, only registered members can access courses.</p>
    <p>Somalia may collect data about the user's location, if the user has configured their device to send this data to
        the application through the device's privacy settings, or if the user has uploaded photos with tags containing
        location information. Somalia may use the location information collected on the user device to improve the use
        of the application by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. Somalia may also collect
        information about the user's searches and, considering their location, may suggest services/establishments
        and/or products that may be relevant to the user.</p>
    <p>Somalia automatically collects some information from the user's computer or device when the user uses the
        Somalia Saúde platform. For example, Somalia will collect session data, including the user's IP address,
        operating system and telephone type. One of Somalia’s reasons in collecting such information is to try to
        understand the user's interests and preferences to personalize and improve the User's experience.</p>
